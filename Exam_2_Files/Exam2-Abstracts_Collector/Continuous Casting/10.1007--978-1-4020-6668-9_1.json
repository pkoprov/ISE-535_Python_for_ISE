We will also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the several techniques, with respect to the achievability of their goals, and we will give a brief overview of \u201chybrid techniques\u201d, techniques that involves fuzzy control as well as other artificial intelligent computing methods, such as neural networks and genetic algorithms."}
