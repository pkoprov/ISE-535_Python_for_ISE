The above steels are used for manufacturing bimetallic rolls of billet continuous casting machines [ 1 ]. Specimens (5x6x30 mm) were cut out from a bimetallic roll band along the axial direction and subjected to uniaxial tension loading at a temperature of +600 0 corresponding to the temperature of the roll surface at the area of contact with the slab billet. Tests were performed on a servo-hydraulic machine of the type STM-100 equipped with an IBM computer."}
