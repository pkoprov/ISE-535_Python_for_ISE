He recognized that biopolymers and synthetic polymers are formed according to the same blueprint. Fighting vigorously against his numerous opponents, he established his concept of macromolecules. Since the pioneering days, his bioinspired molecular design of multifunctional polymeric materials has stimulated remarkable progress in materials science, biosciences, and engineering, accompanied by an extraordinary growth in polymer production. In 1940, Staudinger founded the Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry as the first European center for interdisciplinary polymer research. In 1999, his laboratory was honored as an International Historic Chemical Landmark dedicated to the foundation of polymer sciences. Today, macromolecular (bio)systems engineering, inspired by Staudinger\u2019s visions, plays a prominent role in sustainable development."}
