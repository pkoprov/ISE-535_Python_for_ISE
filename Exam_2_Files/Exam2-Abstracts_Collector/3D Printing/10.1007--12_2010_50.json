The advantages of polymeric biomaterials, compared to metallic or ceramic materials, are the ease of manufacturing components having various and complex shapes, reasonable cost, and their ability to possess a wide range of physical and mechanical properties. Additionally, hydroxyapatite (HAp) is one of the most attractive materials for bone implants because of its composition and biological similarity to natural tissues. It can be obtained in a nanostructured form, which facilitates its fine dispersion in the polymer matrix as well as producing advantageous interactions with bioactive polymer and tissue. This paper reviews recent advances in polymer/(nano)HAp composites and nanocomposites for bone tissue regeneration, with particular emphasis on the material characteristics. Specific topics associated with polymer/HAp composition, molecular orientation and morphology, surface modifications, the interactions between the components, and their biological behaviours are described. Finally, the challenges facing this emerging field of research are outlined."}
