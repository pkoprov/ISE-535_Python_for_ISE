Recent advances in the understanding of how materials passively interact or actively communicate with biological systems via designed material\u2013biology interfaces demand precise means to fabricate macroscopic nanostructured materials. We review modern materials and technology that are available for the production of bioactive scaffolds having spatial control of mechanical, chemical, and biochemical signals at the interface, as well as tailored pore architecture and surface topology."}
