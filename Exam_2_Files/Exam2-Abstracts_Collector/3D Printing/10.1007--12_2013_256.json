Key intermediates of nanostructured polymeric ionic liquids (nanoPILs) are PILs with micelle-like topologies, block copolymers and polymer electrolytes dissolved in ionic liquids (ILs), and nanoparticle dispersions. In contrast to micellar ILs, micelle-like nanoPILs consist of a nonionic hyperbranched polyether core with low glass transition temperature and covalently attached alkyl-substituted IL moieties in its periphery. Such hyperbranched nanoPILs are thermally stable dispersants, nanoreactors, and transporters that are useful in nanoparticle synthesis and polymer melt compounding. As new molecular carbon/polyelectrolyte composite materials, tree-like nanoPILs are grafted onto functionalized graphene. Here, we highlight recent progress made in nanoPIL science and engineering, illustrated by selected examples."}
