Yet, their limitations due to, e.g., interspecies variation are reflected in the high number of drug attrition rates, especially in central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Therefore, human-based neural in vitro models for studying safety and efficacy of substances acting on the CNS are needed. Human iPSC-derived cells offer such a platform with the unique advantage of reproducing the \u201chuman context\u201d in vitro by preserving the genetic and molecular phenotype of their donors. Guiding the differentiation of hiPSC into cells of the nervous system and combining them in a 2D or 3D format allows to obtain complex models suitable for investigating neurotoxicity or brain-related diseases with patient-derived cells. This chapter will give an overview over stem cell-based human 2D neuronal and mixed neuronal/astrocyte models, in vitro cultures of microglia, as well as CNS disease models and considers new developments in the field, more specifically the use of brain organoids and 3D bioprinted in vitro models for safety and efficacy evaluation."}
