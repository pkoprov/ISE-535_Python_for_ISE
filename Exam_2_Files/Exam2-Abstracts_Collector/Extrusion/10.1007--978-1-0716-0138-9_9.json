In this chapter we describe a procedure for DNA-controlled fusion of liposomes mediated by LiNAs that are designed to force bilayers into close proximity. Using a self-quenching fluorescent dye (Sulforhodamine B) to monitor both the mixing of the internal volumes and leakage of the dye into the outer volume we measure the efficiency of content mixing in the bulk population, allowing for direct comparison between different LiNA designs. By generating samples for calibration corresponding to different amounts of content mixing, the average number of fusion events per labeled liposome can be estimated."}
