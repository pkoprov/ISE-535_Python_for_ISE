A feasible way to solve this issue is to gradually decrease the consumption of plastics prepared of petrochemical origin and subsequently substitute it with plastics made up of biodegradable materials. The transformation process of bioplastics materials (starch, polyhydroxyalkanoates, cellulose, and polylactide) for food packaging applications by employing traditional plastic manufacturing techniques such as injection molding, extrusion, and compression molding has been discussed in this chapter. Active packaging is one of the latest packaging techniques which contain active ingredients in them utilized to scavenge free radicals or eradicate undesirable organisms, thereby extending the shelf life of the product. The application of bioplastics materials in the production of active packaging has also been reviewed and discussed in this chapter."}
