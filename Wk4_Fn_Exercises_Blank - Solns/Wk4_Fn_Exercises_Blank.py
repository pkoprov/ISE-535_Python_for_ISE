# Qn 1 Write a program to create a function that simply squares and cubes any number passed to it and returns the value.
#The main program should then print the value to the console screen.
#The main program should also 'unpack' the tuple and print its contents.




#Qn 2 Write a function that takes the length and breadth of a rectangle.
#Return the area, the perimeter and if it is a rectangle or square.






#Qn 3 Write a function that counts the number of even numbers within a list defined by the user. 
#The user enters the numbers on the console, with a comma to separate the numbers. Report the total number of even numbers to the console screen. Example
#Input Enter the numbers (separated by a comma): 1,3,4,6,10,11,12
#Output There are 4 even numbers in the list





#Qn 4 Write a function that takes 2 parameters to compute the area of a triangle.
#A = 1/2 (b * h). Return the value to the main program





#Qn 5 Write a function that finds the maximum value of all the even numbers in a given list of integers.



#Qn 6 Write a function that converts two lists to a single dictionary. Given two lists such as
#keys = ["Binil", "Starly", "Sara", "Evan", "Rachel"]
#scores = [90, 99, 98, 80, 73]
#
#Return dictionary to main program and print the key and corresponding values of the dictionary




#Qn 7 Write a program to merge the following list together so that it outputs all the scores of a given student in the form of a dictionary
#
#Student_Python_Scores=[{'Binil': 90, 'Starly': 80, 'Sara': 99, 'Rohan': 88},
#                       {'Binil': 70, 'Starly': 89, 'Sara': 99, 'Rohan': 77},
#                       {'Binil': 75, 'Starly': 70, 'Sara': 93, 'Rohan': 98}]
#
#The output should be a dictionary as follows:
#{'Binil':[90, 70], 'Starly':[80,89], 'Sara':[99,99], 'Rohan':[88,77]}
#
#Also compute the average scores for the student





#8
#Search for a value in the dictionary below:
#studentScores={"Binil":[34,63,100], "Johanna":[33,22,77], "Evan":[66,21,97], "Ben":[100,5,10]}
#The values represents a list with scores for 3 exams = Exam 1, Exam 2 and Exam 3
#A: Check if anyone has scored a 100. Return a True
#B: Print all students who scored more than 50 in the 3rd exam    



    

#9 Design a menu that has the following options. The menu must continuously be displayed as long as the user has not exited out of the program
#1) Enter the integers
#2) Odd or even
#3) Integer or Float
#4) Is it a Prime Number
#5) Factorial of Number
#6) Exit the Program
